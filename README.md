# Pitch 

## Built By [Nazarine Wasonga](https://github.com/NazarineWasonga/)

## Description
an application that allows users to use that one minute wisely. The users will submit their one minute pitches and other users will vote on them and leave comments to give their feedback on them.


## User Stories
These are the behaviours/features that the application implements for use by a user.

As a user I would like to:
* See the pitches other people have posted.
* submit a pitch in any category.
* be signed in for me to leave a comment
* view the pitches I have created in my profile page.
* comment on the different pitches and leave feedback.
